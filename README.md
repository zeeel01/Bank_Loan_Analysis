 Included Monthly Trends by Issue Date, Regional Analysis by State, Loan Term Analysis, Loan Purpose Breakdown and many more to deep dive into the data, generate meaning full insights and mitigate the future risks. 86.2% loans are either current or paid off; whereas, 14.2% loans are charged-off (not fully paid). Bank can utilize the insights to better predict if new applicant will pay installment on time or not.
